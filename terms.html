        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: January 25, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to Snap2Cal. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Snap2Cal application and services. By using Snap2Cal, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the service.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Snap2Cal is a web application that allows users to create Google Calendar events from photos, screenshots, and images. The service uses artificial intelligence to extract event information from images and add them to your Google Calendar.</p>

        <h2>2. User Accounts and Google Authorization</h2>
        <p>To use Snap2Cal, you must authorize the application to access your Google Calendar through Google's OAuth system. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google account credentials. Snap2Cal does not store your Google password or OAuth tokens on our servers; these are stored locally in your browser.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Processing and Privacy</h2>
        <p>When you upload an image, it is processed in real-time using Anthropic's Claude AI to extract event information. Images are not permanently stored on our servers. Your Google access token and user information are stored locally in your browser using localStorage and are not transmitted to our servers. For complete details on how we handle your data, please refer to our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>

            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the service or its related systems</li>
            <li>Use the service in any way that could damage, disable, or impair the service</li>
            <li>Use automated means to access the service without our permission</li>
            <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Snap2Cal and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Amanda Wold and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You retain ownership of any images you upload to the service.</p>

        <h2>6. Service Availability and Changes</h2>
        <p>Snap2Cal is currently provided as a free service. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time, with or without notice. We may also introduce paid features or subscription plans in the future. We will provide reasonable notice before any significant changes to the service or these Terms.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Snap2Cal integrates with third-party services including Google Calendar and Anthropic's Claude AI. Your use of these third-party services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices of these third-party services.</p>

We do not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. The AI-powered event extraction may not always be accurate, and you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of any calendar events created.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p class="disclaimer">To the maximum extent permitted by law, Amanda Wold shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from your use of the service.</p>

        <h2>11. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using Snap2Cal at any time by revoking the application's access to your Google account through your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account settings</a>. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the service at any time, without prior notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users or the service.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

        <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms on our website with a new effective date. Your continued use of the service after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
